## About

In this project I learnt how to create our own Dashboard extension for Google Chrome, it is based on the Momentum Dashboard.

I had added features using APIS like current time and date, openweather API, motivational quotes and background images from unsplash

As an stretch goal I also added a ToDo list that saves the info to localStorage

## What I Learnt doing this project

- APIs and how to fetch them: open weather, Unsplash, and Coin Gecko(although I did not use this in my final code)
- Chrome Extension
- Javascript
- Flexbox
